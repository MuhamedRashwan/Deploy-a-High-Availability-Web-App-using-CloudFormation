# Deploy-a-High-Availability-Web-App-using-CloudFormation
In this project, Weâ€™ll deploy web servers for a highly available web app using CloudFormation. We will write the code that creates and deploys the infrastructure and application for an Instagram-like app from the ground up. We will begin with deploying the networking components, followed by servers, security roles and software.
